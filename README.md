Here, I perform RNA_Seq analysis to determine genes that are differentioally expressed at different stages in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem. The samples are collected at day 8, 16. Data files are including (“Day8.fastq” and “Day16.fastq”) the samples are collected, extracted and being sequenced the cellular mRNA, and now set to perform the bioinformatics analysis. 

The refernce genome is under athal_chr.fa and the reference gene annotation are in "athal_genes.gtf".
